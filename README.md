• Developed UF ride network, handling 2000 active ride requests while enabling search, booking, cancellation, and updates.
• Utilized advanced data structures such as MinHeap and RedBlackTrees for the implementation.
• The Min-Heap data structure has been implemented to store the ride details i.e., (rideNumber, rideCost, tripDuration) ordered by the rideCost and tripDuration(in case two rides have the same rideCost - given that every rideCost-tripDuration combination will be unique).
• The Red-Black tree data structure has been implemented to store the ride details i.e., (rideNumber, rideCost, tripDuration) ordered by the rideNumber.
